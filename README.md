Fictions [improover](https://github.com/Fiction52s/Melee-Improover) tool made me realize it'd be nice if rwing showed me notes for all the times I pressed a specific trigger button combo (in this case, just dpad-down).

I wrote this quick proof of concept to append these note to slp/slpz replays for my own use and would love to add this to rwing itself to run upon opening a replay rather than doing it out of band with my own scripts/inotify watcher stuff.
